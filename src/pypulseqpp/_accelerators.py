"""Loading the compiled kernels that ship inside the wheel.

``pypulseqpp._ext`` is one extension module, built for each interpreter this
package supports. A kernel that will not import therefore means a broken
installation -- most often a wheel built for one interpreter imported from
another -- and never an optional extra a caller may reasonably do without.

:func:`require` says so, naming the mismatch, rather than letting a caller
fall through to a slower Python path whose only symptom is unexplained
runtime.
