def make_rf_shim(shim_vector) -> SimpleNamespace:
    """Create an RF shim extension event.

    On a parallel-transmit system each channel plays the same RF envelope
    scaled by its own complex weight. This event carries that weight vector
    for a block, so a single designed pulse can be re-shimmed per slice or per
    excitation without redesigning the envelope.

    Parameters
    ----------
    shim_vector : array_like
        Complex per-channel weights, one per transmit channel.

    Returns
    -------
    types.SimpleNamespace
        RF shim extension event (``type == 'rf_shim'``) with the weights
        stored as ``complex128``.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> import pypulseqpp as pp
    >>> event = pp.make_rf_shim([1.0, 1j, -1.0, -1j])
    >>> event.type, event.shim_vector.dtype
    ('rf_shim', dtype('complex128'))

    Attach it alongside the RF event of a block::

        seq.add_block(pulse.rf, pp.make_rf_shim(weights))
