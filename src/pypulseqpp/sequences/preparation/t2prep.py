class T2Preparation(RfModule):
    """A 90 - 180 - 90 sandwich that leaves T2 weighting on the z axis.

    Magnetization is tipped into the transverse plane, left to decay for the
    preparation echo time, and put back on ``z``. What the readout then sees is
    already T2-weighted, whatever its own echo time is -- which is the point:
    the contrast is decoupled from the acquisition, so a bSSFP or a short-TE
    gradient echo can carry T2 contrast it could never generate itself.

    Every pulse is adiabatic and non-selective. The 90s are half passages, run
    forwards to tip down and time-reversed to store -- the mirror is what
    makes the storage undo the excitation rather than repeat it. The 180s in
    the middle are full passages.

    **Refocusing pulses come in pairs, and the count must be even.** An
    adiabatic full passage inverts z cleanly but leaves transverse
    magnetization with a phase that depends on transmit amplitude, so it is
    not a refocusing pulse on its own; a second one undoes what the first did.
    Simulated over 0.7 to 1.3 of nominal B1, a pair restores 0.80 to 1.00 of
    the magnetization while a single pulse ranges from -0.69 to +0.98. An odd
    count is refused rather than corrected: the leftover phase is not half a
    turn -- it measures about 202 degrees for these pulses -- so there is no
    phase to hard-code that would stay right for another duration or sweep.

    Parameters
    ----------
    system : pypulseq.Opts
        System limits.
    echo_time_s : float
        Preparation echo time (s), first pulse centre to last.
    final_tip : {'up', 'down'}, optional
        Store on ``+z`` (pure T2 weighting) or ``-z``, which starts a T1
        recovery as well -- see :class:`T1T2Preparation`.
    n_refocus : int, optional
        Adiabatic refocusing pulses, spread evenly through the echo time. Must
        be even; see above.
    half_passage_duration_s : float, optional
        Duration of each 90 (s).
    refocusing_duration_s : float, optional
        Duration of each 180 (s).
    adiabaticity : int, optional
        Sweep-rate margin over the adiabatic condition, for every pulse.
    dwell_s : float, optional
        RF raster (s).
    spoiling_cycles : float, optional
        Cycles of dephasing the closing spoiler winds across ``voxel_size_m``.
        Zero leaves the module unspoiled, which is only right if something
        downstream spoils.
    voxel_size_m : float, optional
        Length the dephasing is counted over (m).
    labels : sequence of str, optional
        Counters emitted on the first pulse's block. A preparation is where a
        shot begins, so it is the natural place to say which shot this is.

    Attributes
    ----------
    rf_prep : RfEvent
        The half passage that tips down.
    rf_ref : RfEvent
        The refocusing pulse, published once because every repeat plays the
        same event.
    rf_store : RfEvent
        The reverse half passage that stores what is left.
    wait_te : DelayEvent
        The gap around each refocusing pulse. Absent when the pulses already
        fill the echo time.
    gx_spoil, gy_spoil, gz_spoil : GradEvent
        The closing spoiler.
    prep_labels : LabelSetEvent or list of LabelSetEvent
        One per name in ``labels``.
    echo_time : float
        The preparation echo time achieved (s).

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``final_tip`` is not a pole, ``n_refocus`` is not a positive even
        number, a size is out of range, or the echo time is shorter than the
        pulses themselves.

    Examples
    --------

    >>> import pypulseqpp as pp
    >>> prep = design.T2Preparation(pp.Opts(), 50e-3)
    >>> round(prep.echo_time * 1e3, 2)

    Tipped down, refocused twice, tipped back: over the band the refocusing
    covers, the whole module returns the magnetisation to z, and what it lost
    on the way is T2 weighting:
