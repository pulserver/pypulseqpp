    """Adiabatic pair that tips magnetization down and puts it back.

    A half passage is one half of a full adiabatic sweep. Run from far
    off-resonance to on-resonance, it carries magnetization from ``+z`` into
    the transverse plane; run in reverse, it carries it back. Both are
    adiabatic, so above a threshold transmit amplitude neither cares what the
    amplitude actually is -- which is the whole reason a preparation uses them
    instead of a pair of hard 90s.

    The two are exact mirrors: the second is the first time-reversed and
    conjugated. That is what makes the phase the sweep accrues on the way down
    unwind on the way up, so what is stored is the magnetization's *magnitude*
    and not a phase that varied with transmit field.

    Parameters
    ----------
    system : pypulseq.Opts
        System limits.
    duration_s : float
        Duration of each half passage (s).
    adiabaticity : int, optional
        Sweep-rate margin over the adiabatic condition. The default is twice
        an inversion's, because a half passage has only half a sweep to
        converge in and is measurably worse at the inversion default.
    dwell_s : float, optional
        RF raster (s).
    pulse_type : str, optional
        Sweep family, as :func:`pypulseq.make_adiabatic_pulse` names them.

    Returns
    -------
    rf_prep : RfEvent
        The half passage that tips down.
    rf_store : RfEvent
        The reverse half passage that stores what is left back on ``z``.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> import pypulseqpp as pp
    >>> from pypulseqpp.sequences.preparation._common import half_passages
    >>> down, up = half_passages(pp.Opts(), 4e-3)
    >>> bool(np.allclose(np.asarray(down.signal), np.conj(np.asarray(up.signal))[::-1]))
