class OffResonanceSaturation(RfModule):
    """A train of off-resonance pulses, optionally spoiled.

    The layout every off-resonance preparation has: the same pulse played
    ``n_pulses`` times back to back, then a spoiler if one was asked for. One
    event, replayed, so it publishes as one ``rf_prep`` however long the train
    is.

    Subclass this to add a family: design the pulse and hand it over. What
    makes each family is the envelope and the offset -- an SLR passband for
    magnetization transfer, a Fermi plateau for Bloch-Siegert -- and neither
    changes anything below.

    Parameters
    ----------
    system : pypulseq.Opts
        System limits.
    rf_prep : RfEvent
        The pulse to play.
    n_pulses : int, optional
        Times to play it.
    spoiling_cycles : float, optional
        Cycles of dephasing the closing spoiler winds across ``voxel_size_m``.
        Zero omits the spoiler, which is what a pulse whose effect is a phase
        rather than a saturation needs.
    voxel_size_m : float, optional
        Length the dephasing is counted over (m).
    labels : sequence of str, optional
        Counters emitted on the first pulse's block.

    Attributes
    ----------
    rf_prep : RfEvent
        The pulse, published once however many times it is played.
    gx_spoil, gy_spoil, gz_spoil : GradEvent
        The closing spoiler, when there is one.
    prep_labels : LabelSetEvent or list of LabelSetEvent
        One per name in ``labels``.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``n_pulses`` is below one, or a spoiling argument is out of range.

    Examples
    --------
    The pulse is the family's; the train and the spoiler are this class's.

class IhMtPreparation(OffResonanceSaturation):
    """Saturation at both offsets at once, for the inhomogeneous MT difference.

    The bound pool has a component whose lineshape is inhomogeneously
    broadened, and saturating one side of water leaves it partly unsaturated
    while saturating both sides at once does not. Acquiring both and taking
    the difference isolates that component:
    ``ihMT = (MT+ + MT-) / 2 - MT_dual``, where the two single-offset arms are
    :class:`MtPreparation` at plus and minus ``freq_offset_hz`` and this module
    is the dual-offset one.

    Dual-offset means *simultaneously*, not alternately, so the pulse is built
    by modulating one envelope into two bands with
    :func:`~pypulseqpp.make_sms_pulse` -- the same wrapper that turns
    one slice into several -- and shifting the pair so neither band lands on
    water.

    **The two arms are matched on power, not on amplitude.** Deposited power
    goes as the integral of the squared envelope, and two bands each at
    ``A / sqrt(2)`` integrate to the same as one band at ``A`` -- so that is
    the scaling used, and what the subtraction removes is the inhomogeneous
    saturation rather than a power difference. It costs peak amplitude: the
    two bands add in phase at the centre of the pulse, so the dual pulse peaks
    about 1.41 times higher than the single-offset one at the same setting.

    Parameters
    ----------
    system : pypulseq.Opts
        System limits.
    flip_angle_deg : float, optional
        Flip angle (degrees) of the single-offset arm this one is matched
        against. Each band gets ``1 / sqrt(2)`` of it.
    freq_offset_hz : float, optional
        Distance of each band from water (Hz), positive. Both signs are built.
    duration_s : float, optional
        Pulse duration (s).
    time_bw_product : float, optional
        Time-bandwidth product of each band.
    n_pulses : int, optional
        Pulses in the train.

    A strong pulse far from resonance barely tips anything, but it shifts the
    water resonance by an amount proportional to the square of the transmit
    amplitude. Acquiring one image with the pulse at ``+f`` and one at ``-f``
    turns that shift into a phase difference, and the phase difference into a
    B1 map. Nothing about the readout changes.

    Two things follow from what the pulse is for. There is **no spoiler** --
    the module runs between the excitation and the readout, and spoiling would
    destroy the very signal that is meant to carry the phase. And the envelope
    is a **Fermi** function: a flat top with smooth shoulders, which keeps the
    time-integrated squared amplitude high (the shift is proportional to it)
    while keeping the spectral tails away from water.

    The calibration constants a reconstruction needs come back on the module:
    ``kbs`` is the shift per unit squared Pulseq amplitude and
    ``kbs_per_gauss2`` the same in the conventional rad/G^2.

    peak_b1_hz : float, optional
        Plateau amplitude, in Pulseq units.
    flat_fraction : float, optional

    transition_fraction : float, optional
        Width of each shoulder, as a fraction of the duration.
    dwell_s : float, optional
        RF raster (s).
    n_pulses, spoiling_cycles, voxel_size_m, labels
        As :class:`OffResonanceSaturation`. ``spoiling_cycles`` defaults to
        zero here, for the reason above.

    Attributes
    ----------
    rf_prep : RfEvent
        The Fermi pulse.
    kbs : float
        Phase shift per unit squared Pulseq amplitude (rad).
    kbs_per_gauss2 : float
        The same constant in rad/G^2.

    Raises
