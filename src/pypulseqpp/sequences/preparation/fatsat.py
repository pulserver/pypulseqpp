class FatSaturation(RfModule):
    """A fat-selective pulse and the spoiler that discards what it tipped.

    An SLR ``"sat"`` pulse tips fat past the transverse plane -- 110 degrees by
    default, so the residual is insensitive to a transmit field that falls
    short -- and the spoiler destroys what it tipped.

    ``thickness_m`` makes it a band rather than the whole volume;
    ``position_mm`` and ``orientation`` place that band here, at design time,
    through :class:`~pypulseqpp.TransformFOV`. The module then sets
    ``NOPOS`` and ``NOROT`` on its first block and clears them on its last, so
    a transform applied to the finished scan moves the imaging volume and
    leaves the band where it was put.

    A band that is both fat- and slice-selective is displaced along its own
    selection axis by the chemical shift, which is why one is usually made
    generously thick.

    Parameters
    ----------
    system : pypulseq.Opts
        System limits.
    freq_offset_ppm : float, optional
        Fat offset from water (ppm). Carried on the pulse as a ppm offset
        rather than as hertz, so the interpreter resolves it against the
        field the scan actually runs at.
    flip_angle_deg : float, optional
        Saturation flip angle (degrees).
    bandwidth_hz : float, optional
        Spectral passband (Hz). With ``time_bw_product`` it fixes the pulse
        duration, which is ``time_bw_product / bandwidth_hz``.
    time_bw_product : float, optional
        Time-bandwidth product.
    thickness_m : float, optional
        Band thickness (m). ``None`` saturates the whole transmit volume,
        which is the usual fat saturation and the only form that needs no
        gradient.
    axis : {'z', 'x', 'y'}, optional
        Band normal, before ``orientation`` turns it.
    position_mm : sequence of float, optional
        ``(dx, dy, dz)`` offset of the band from the isocentre, in the logical
        frame, in millimetres. Needs ``thickness_m``.
    orientation : array_like or scipy.spatial.transform.Rotation, optional
        A ``(3, 3)`` matrix, or a rotation, taking the logical frame to the one
        the band should sit in. Needs ``thickness_m``.
    use_rotation_extension : bool, optional
        Carry the orientation as a ``ROTATIONS`` extension rather than baking
        it into new waveforms. Only ``True`` is implemented; see
        :class:`~pypulseqpp.TransformFOV`.
    spoiling_cycles : float, optional
        Cycles of dephasing each spoiler axis winds across ``voxel_size_m``.
    voxel_size_m : float, optional
        Length the dephasing is counted over (m).

    Attributes
    ----------
    rf_prep : RfEvent
        The saturation pulse, as placed.
    gz : GradEvent
        Its selection gradient. Only when ``thickness_m`` was given, and named
        for the logical axis whatever ``axis`` was.
    gx_spoil, gy_spoil, gz_spoil : GradEvent
        The three-axis spoiler. Three axes rather than one because what is
        being destroyed is a full excitation, not a residue.
    prep_labels : list of LabelSetEvent
        ``NOPOS`` and ``NOROT``, set on the first block.
    reset_labels : list of LabelSetEvent
        The same two cleared, on the last.
    freq_offset_ppm : float
        The fat offset the pulse carries (ppm).
    freq_offset_hz : float
        What that comes to at ``system.B0`` (Hz), for reference; the pulse
        itself is field-independent.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If a bandwidth, thickness or voxel size is not positive, ``axis`` is
        not a gradient channel, the spoiler was asked for zero cycles, or a
        position or orientation was given for a band that has no thickness.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import pypulseqpp.sequences as design
    >>> import pypulseqpp as pp
    >>> fatsat = design.FatSaturation(pp.Opts(B0=3.0))
    >>> len(fatsat.blocks), round(fatsat.freq_offset_hz)
    (2, -441)

    The exemption is on the pulse's own block, alongside it rather than in a
    block of its own:

    >>> [event.type for event in fatsat.blocks[0]]
    ['rf', 'labelset', 'labelset']

    A band, tilted and offset, that a later FOV transform will leave alone::

        from scipy.spatial.transform import Rotation

        band = design.FatSaturation(
            system, thickness_m=0.08, position_mm=(0.0, 0.0, 25.0),
            orientation=Rotation.from_euler("y", 30, degrees=True),
        )

    What the pulse leaves along z, across the spectrum. The band sits at the
    fat resonance and water is untouched:
