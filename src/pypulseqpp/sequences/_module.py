class SequenceModule(ABC):
    """A reusable group of Pulseq blocks, designed once and named.

    Pulseq gives you *events* and *blocks*; a sequence is the loop you write
    over them. A module is the missing middle: the handful of blocks that
    always travel together — an excitation with its slice-select and rephaser,
    a preparation with its spoiler, one whole readout TR. It solves its
    gradients, budgets its TE and TR and lands its ADC on both rasters **once**,
    at construction, and then hands the results back under the names its
    constructor gave them.

    A subclass writes :meth:`init_module`, and it reads like an ordinary
    PyPulseq script::

        class Readout(SequenceModule):
            def init_module(self, system, num_arms=1):
                rf = pp.make_block_pulse(flip_angle=0.2, duration=1e-3, system=system)
                gread = [pp.make_trapezoid("x", area=a, system=system) for a in areas]
                adc = pp.make_adc(num_samples=256, dwell=4e-6, system=system)
                self.seq = pp.Sequence(system)
                for n in range(num_arms):
                    self.seq.add_block(rf)
                    self.seq.add_block(gread[n], adc)

    Everything that reached a block is published under the local variable that
    held it, so the caller writes ``readout.rf``, ``readout.adc``,
    ``readout.gread[n]`` — or ``readout.events.rf``, which is the same object
    and is how to reach an event whose name collides with one of the module's
    own attributes.

    **What a name is published as depends on how many distinct objects wore
    it.** Every event is recorded each time it reaches a block, and the
    recording is then deduplicated by identity: one survivor is published as
    that object, several as a list in play order. So ``rf`` above — one pulse
    added ``num_arms`` times — is a single event, while ``gread`` — one
    gradient per arm — stays a list. A ``gread`` built as ``num_arms``
    references to *one* gradient collapses back to that gradient, which is the
    right answer: a trajectory whose arms are a rotation of a base arm has one
    waveform, however many times it is played.

    :meth:`register` publishes the structure it is handed instead of deducing
    one, for the cases where a one-entry list has to stay a list.

    Using a module is never required, and a module never writes a scan loop.
    It owns the design; the plugin owns the loop::

        for shot, angle in enumerate(angles):
            readout.rf.phase_offset = phases[shot]
            seq.add_block(readout.rf)
            seq.add_block(readout.gread[shot], readout.adc)

    Parameters
    ----------
    *args, **kwargs
        Passed straight to :meth:`init_module`.

    Attributes
    ----------
    events : types.SimpleNamespace
        Every published event, by name.
    center : float
        Time from the start of the module to the point it is timed against —
        an RF pulse's isodelay, a readout's echo. The subclass sets it.

    See Also
    --------
    pypulseqpp.sequences : the shipped excitation, preparation and readout modules.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import pypulseqpp as pp
    >>> from pypulseqpp.sequences import SequenceModule
    >>> class Readout(SequenceModule):
    ...     def init_module(self, system, num_arms=2):
    ...         rf = pp.make_block_pulse(flip_angle=0.2, duration=1e-3, system=system)
    ...         gread = [pp.make_trapezoid("x", area=100 * (n + 1), system=system)
    ...                  for n in range(num_arms)]
    ...         adc = pp.make_adc(num_samples=256, duration=2e-3, system=system)
    ...         self.seq = pp.Sequence(system)

    ...             self.seq.add_block(gread[n], adc)
    >>> readout = Readout(pp.Opts())

    One pulse played on every arm is published as the event itself; one
    gradient per arm stays a list, in play order:

    >>> readout.rf.type
    'rf'
    >>> len(readout.gread)
    2
    >>> round(readout.duration, 6)
