class SmsExcitation(RfModule):
    """A slice-selective pulse modulated to excite several slices at once.

    A gradient turns frequency into position, so multiplying one designed pulse
    by a sum of complex exponentials excites a comb of slices for the price of
    one. What it costs is peak B1: the bands add in phase at the centre of the
    pulse, so a ``n``-band pulse peaks at ``n`` times the single-band one unless
    the phases are spread. ``phases='quadratic'`` does that, and is what makes a
    high band count feasible at all.

    The band spacing is stated as a **slice gap** and converted through the
    selection gradient the module built, so the answer follows the pulse rather
    than having to be recomputed whenever the thickness or duration changes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    system : pypulseq.Opts
        System limits.
    flip_angle_deg : float
        Nominal flip angle (degrees), per band.
    thickness_m : float
        Slice thickness (m).
    slice_gap_m : float
        Centre-to-centre spacing between excited slices (m).
    n_bands : int, optional
        Slices excited at once.
    duration_s : float, optional
        Pulse duration (s).
    phases : {'quadratic'} or sequence of float, optional
        Per-band phase (rad). ``'quadratic'`` spreads the peak; ``None`` leaves
        every band in phase, which is the worst case for peak B1.
    rephase : bool, optional
        Build a rephaser at all.
    time_bw_product : float, optional
        Time-bandwidth product of the underlying slice profile.
    axis : {'z', 'x', 'y'}, optional
        Selection axis.
    use : str, optional
        What the pulse is for; the trajectory core reads it.

    Attributes
    ----------
    rf : RfEvent
        The modulated pulse.
    gz : TrapEvent
        The selection gradient.
    gz_reph : TrapEvent
        Its rephaser, when ``rephase``.
    band_offsets_hz : numpy.ndarray
        Where each band sits (Hz), zero among them.
    band_positions_m : numpy.ndarray
        The same, as slice positions (m).
    peak_ratio : float
        Peak B1 relative to the single-band pulse the bands were made from.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If a size is not positive, ``n_bands`` is below one, or ``axis`` is not
        a gradient channel.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import pypulseqpp.sequences as design
    >>> import pypulseqpp as pp
    >>> system = pp.Opts(max_grad=40, grad_unit="mT/m", max_slew=180, slew_unit="T/m/s")
    >>> sms = design.SmsExcitation(
    ...     system, 60.0, thickness_m=3e-3, slice_gap_m=24e-3, n_bands=3
    ... )
    >>> sms.band_positions_m.round(6).tolist()
    [-0.024, 0.0, 0.024]

    Spreading the band phases is what keeps the peak down:

    >>> stacked = design.SmsExcitation(
    ...     system, 60.0, thickness_m=3e-3, slice_gap_m=24e-3, n_bands=3, phases=None
    ... )
    >>> round(stacked.peak_ratio, 1), bool(sms.peak_ratio < stacked.peak_ratio)
    (3.0, True)

class MultibandExcitation(RfModule):
    """A pulse with off-resonance sidebands and no gradient at all.

    The same modulation :class:`SmsExcitation` uses, with nothing to turn
    frequency into position -- so the sidebands saturate wherever their offset
    reaches rather than exciting a slice. That is what an inhomogeneous
    magnetisation transfer experiment wants: the on-resonance band tips the
    free pool by ``flip_angle_deg`` while the sidebands deposit power into the
    bound pool, and comparing one sideband against two symmetric ones at the
    **same total power** is the ihMT measurement.

    Power, not amplitude, is what has to match. Two sidebands each at
    ``sqrt(beta/2)`` of the centre band's amplitude carry the same total
    ``|B1|^2`` as one at ``sqrt(beta)``, and halving an amplitude instead --
    which looks natural -- delivers half the power and turns the ihMT
    difference into a power difference.

    Give ``b1rms_ut`` and ``tr`` to have the sideband power solved for a total
    root-mean-square B1 over the repetition, which is how the experiment is
    normally specified; give ``sideband_power`` to state it directly.

    Parameters
    ----------
    system : pypulseq.Opts
        System limits.
    flip_angle_deg : float
        On-resonance flip angle (degrees).
    duration_s : float
        Pulse duration (s).
    band_offset_hz : float
        Sideband offset from the on-resonance band (Hz).
    n_bands : int, optional
        Bands counting the on-resonance one: two for a single sideband, three
        for a symmetric pair.
    sideband_power : float, optional
        Power of *each* sideband relative to the on-resonance band. Ignored
        when ``b1rms_ut`` is given.
    b1rms_ut : float, optional
        Target root-mean-square B1 over the repetition (uT), from which the
        sideband power is solved. Needs ``tr``.
    tr : float, optional
        The repetition the RMS is taken over (s).
    time_bw_product : float, optional
        Time-bandwidth product of the underlying envelope.
    use : str, optional
        What the pulse is for; the trajectory core reads it.

    Attributes
    ----------
    rf : RfEvent
        The modulated pulse.
    band_offsets_hz : numpy.ndarray
        Where each band sits (Hz), zero among them.
    band_power_fraction : numpy.ndarray
        Share of the total ``|B1|^2`` each band carries.
    sideband_power : float
        Power of each sideband relative to the on-resonance band, whether it
        was given or solved.
    b1rms_ut : float
        Root-mean-square B1 achieved over ``tr``, when one was given.
    peak_ut : float
        Peak B1 (uT), which is what a transmit chain limits.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If a size is out of range, ``b1rms_ut`` is given without ``tr``, or the
        on-resonance band alone already exceeds the requested ``b1rms_ut``.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import pypulseqpp.sequences as design
    >>> import pypulseqpp as pp
    >>> system = pp.Opts()
    >>> dual = design.MultibandExcitation(
    ...     system, 7.0, duration_s=2e-3, band_offset_hz=7000.0, n_bands=3,
    ...     b1rms_ut=2.0, tr=30e-3,
    ... )
    >>> dual.band_offsets_hz.tolist()
    [-7000.0, 0.0, 7000.0]
    >>> round(dual.b1rms_ut, 6)
    2.0

    Two sidebands or one, the total power is the same -- which is what makes
    the difference between them an ihMT measurement rather than a power one:

    >>> single = design.MultibandExcitation(
    ...     system, 7.0, duration_s=2e-3, band_offset_hz=7000.0, n_bands=2,
    ...     b1rms_ut=2.0, tr=30e-3,
    ... )
    >>> round(single.b1rms_ut, 6)
    2.0

    One sideband therefore carries exactly what two carry between them:

    >>> single.sideband_power == 2 * dual.sideband_power
    True

    Three bands in frequency and none in space, which is what makes this a
    saturation rather than a slice selection:
