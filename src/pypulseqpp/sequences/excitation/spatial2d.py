class SpatialSelective2DExcitation(RfModule):
    """Small-tip spiral excitation selective in two dimensions.

    The selected disc extends along the unencoded axis. Its periodic replicas
    are set by the excitation FOV, which should cover the object. Each arm
    is retraced with RF off; the closed trajectory needs no separate rephaser.

    Parameters
    ----------
    system : pypulseq.Opts
        System limits.
    flip_angle_deg : float
        Nominal flip angle (degrees), reached at the centre of the disc.
    fov : float
        Excitation field of view (m), square. The distance to the first
        repeated disc.
    matrix : int
        Excitation grid size, square. How finely the profile is specified, and
        so how far out the trajectory reaches.
    selective_size : float or sequence of float, optional
        Diameter (m) of the excited disc. Half the field of view by default.
    target : numpy.ndarray, optional
        Complex desired profile on the ``(matrix, matrix)`` grid, instead of a
        disc.
    n_interleaves : int, optional
        Spiral arms to play. The default covers excitation k-space at Nyquist;
        fewer is a proportionally shorter pulse and a repeated disc that moves
        proportionally closer.
    axes : sequence of str, optional
        The two gradient channels the trajectory runs on.
    use : str, optional
        Pulseq RF-use tag, used by trajectory integration.

    Attributes
    ----------
    rf : RfEvent
        The pulse.
    gradients : tuple of GradEvent
        One per axis, played in the pulse's own block.
    rephasers : tuple of TrapEvent
        Empty for the spiral trajectory; the attribute is there because a
        different path would need one.
    self_refocused : bool
        Whether the trajectory came back to the origin on its own.
    duration_s : float
        Pulse length (s), which the trajectory fixed.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If a size is out of range, ``target`` does not match ``matrix``, or the
        requested profile has no response on the trajectory.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import pypulseqpp.sequences as design
    >>> import pypulseqpp as pp
    >>> system = pp.Opts(max_grad=40, grad_unit="mT/m", max_slew=150, slew_unit="T/m/s")
    >>> pencil = design.SpatialSelective2DExcitation(
    ...     system, 30.0, fov=0.256, matrix=32, selective_size=0.04
    ... )
    >>> len(pencil.blocks), [gradient.channel for gradient in pencil.gradients]
    (1, ['x', 'y'])

    >>> pencil.self_refocused, pencil.rephasers
    (True, ())
