    A sinusoid on the phase axis and a cosinusoid on the partition axis, a
    quarter period apart, turn the readout into a corkscrew: every voxel is
    smeared along it, the further from the centre the further, so the aliasing
    parallel imaging has to separate is spread out with it.

    Both events are **self-balanced** -- they enter and leave at zero and their
    net area is exactly zero. That is what lets a scan switch the wave off for
    one readout by scaling the event to zero: no rewinder anywhere has to know
    whether it was played, so the readout's own encoding is untouched either
    way. A cosinusoid does not start at zero on its own, so both axes are
    brought in and out over a quarter period at each end, and whatever area
    that leaves is taken back over the same envelope.

    Parameters
    ----------
    system
        The limits the gradients are built against.
    flat_time
        The readout lobe's flat top, where the samples are. The corkscrew
        lives entirely inside it.
    delay
        Where the flat top starts within the block, which is the readout
        lobe's rise time.
    cycles
        Periods of the sinusoid across the flat top.
    amplitude
        Requested peak, in T/m. **A ceiling, not a prescription**: a sinusoid
        of angular frequency ``w`` slews at ``amplitude * w``, so a fast
        corkscrew is bounded by the slew rate rather than by what was asked
        for, and what gets built is the lower of the two.
    mode
        Which axes to drive: ``"phase"``, ``"partition"`` or ``"both"``.

    Returns
    -------
    dict
        The events for the axes the mode drives, by channel, and
