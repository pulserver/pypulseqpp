    """One excitation and a CPMG echo train, to the end of the TR.

    Each refocusing pulse sits midway between the RF centre or echo before it
    and the echo after it. Echoes are ``esp`` apart, except that the first
    echo is ``esp_first`` after the excitation. Phase encodes, and the
    refocusing amplitude, are templates the loop may scale per echo; the
    sampling order sets the effective TE.

    Attributes
    ----------
    rf : RfEvent
        The excitation.
    gz : GradEvent
        Its selection gradient, if one was given.
    gz_reph : GradEvent
        Its rephaser, if one was given, left-aligned in the block that carries
        the prephaser so it runs straight off the selection lobe.
    rf_ref : RfEvent
        The refocusing pulse, one event for the whole train.
    gz_ref : GradEvent
        Its selection gradient and crushers, if one was given.
    gx_pre : TrapEvent
        Read prephaser, played once before the train and right-aligned in its
        block.
    gx_bridge_pre, gx_bridge_post : GradEvent
        The lobes that carry the read axis, and the crushers, onto and off the
        readout plateau, one each side of every acquisition. Each spans its
        whole block, so the echo timing holds when the loop leaves an encode
        out.
    gx : GradEvent
        The readout plateau, flat from end to end.
    gy_pre, gz_pre : TrapEvent
        Phase encodes at their largest step, to be scaled per echo. ``gz_pre``
        is 3D only.
    gy_rew, gz_rew : TrapEvent
        The encodes negated, unwinding each line before the next refocusing
        pulse.
    gy_wave, gz_wave : GradEvent
        The wave corkscrew under the plateau, each self-balanced so scaling one
        to zero changes nothing else. Only the channels ``wave`` drives.
    adc : AdcEvent
        The acquisition window, shared by every echo.
    adc_labels : LabelSetEvent or list of LabelSetEvent
        One per name in ``labels``; a bare event when there is one.
    wait_esp1 : DelayEvent
        Played after the first refocusing pulse only, when ``esp_first``
        exceeds ``esp``. Absent otherwise.
    wait_tr : DelayEvent
        Present only when a TR longer than the minimum was asked for.
    esp : float
        Echo spacing (s).
    esp_first : float
        Spacing of the first echo (s), equal to ``esp`` unless the excitation
        needed more room.
    echo_times : numpy.ndarray
        Each echo's time (s) from the excitation isodelay.
    bandwidth_hz : float
        Achieved ADC sampling rate (Hz).
    n_samples : int
        Samples per echo.
    center_sample : int
        Index of the sample at the echo; partial echo moves it toward the
        start.
    delta_kx : float
        Read-axis k-space step (1/m).
    readout_duration : float
        Sampling window (s).
    wave_amplitude : float
        Peak wave gradient achieved (T/m), below the requested one where the
        slew rate binds; zero without ``wave``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    system : pypulseq.Opts
        System limits.
    rf : RfEvent
        The excitation that opens the repetition.
    gz : GradEvent, optional
        A selection gradient played in the same block as ``rf``.
    gz_reph : GradEvent, optional
        The rephaser that unwinds ``gz``. A slab excitation
        (``is_slab=True``) has already merged it into ``gz`` and passes
        nothing.
    rf_ref : RfEvent
        The refocusing pulse, which must be built with ``use="refocusing"``:
        :class:`~pypulseqpp.sequences.SpatialSelectiveRefocusing`'s ``rf_ref``
        for a selective train,
        :class:`~pypulseqpp.sequences.NonSelectiveRefocusing`'s for a
        hard-pulse train.
    gz_ref : GradEvent, optional
        Selection gradient for ``rf_ref`` with its crushers, as one event
        played in the pulse's block: the ``gz`` of
        :class:`~pypulseqpp.sequences.SpatialSelectiveRefocusing`. A
        non-selective train passes nothing and crushes on the read axis
        through ``spoiling_cycles``.
    fov : float or sequence of float
        Field of view (m), per encoded axis, readout first.
    matrix : int or sequence of int
        Matrix size per encoded axis, used to set gradient areas. The scan
        loop controls the number and order of acquired lines.
    etl : int, optional
        Echo train length: refocusing pulses, and encoded lines, per
        repetition.
    esp : float, optional
        Echo spacing (s). ``None`` is as short as possible.
    esp_first : float, optional
        Spacing of the first echo (s). ``None`` is the shortest that
        accommodates the excitation, which is ``esp`` whenever the excitation
        fits in half of one. Rounded so that ``esp_first - esp`` is a multiple
        of twice the block raster.
    tr : float, optional
        Repetition time (s), over the whole module. ``None`` is as short as
        possible.
    partial_echo : float, optional
        Fraction of the full echo acquired, in ``(0.5, 1]``. Truncates the
        samples before the echo.
    oversampling : float, optional
        Read oversampling: ``delta_kx`` shrinks and the sampled field of view
        grows, while resolution is fixed by ``fov`` and ``matrix``.
    readout_bandwidth_hz : float, optional
        Requested ADC sampling rate (Hz). ``bandwidth_hz`` reports the
        achieved raster-compatible rate.
    spoiling_cycles : float, optional
        Read-axis crushing each side of every acquisition, in cycles across
        ``voxel_size_m``.
    voxel_size_m : float, optional
        Length the crushing is counted over (m). The read resolution by
        default.
    labels : sequence of str, optional
        Counters emitted on the acquisition block. The loop writes the values.
    trigger : event, optional
        A trigger or digital output armed on the prephaser block.
    wave : {'phase', 'partition', 'both'}, optional
        Wave-CAIPI encoding under every readout plateau: a sine on y, a cosine
        on z, or both. 3D only.
    wave_cycles : int, optional
        Wave periods across the sampling window.
    wave_amplitude : float, optional
        Requested peak wave gradient (T/m). A ceiling: the slew rate may
        lower it, and ``wave_amplitude`` on the module reports what was built.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If a count or fraction is out of range, ``wave`` is set on a 2D train,
        ``gz_reph`` is on the read channel, ``rf_ref`` is not marked as a
        refocusing pulse, or the requested echo spacing or TR is shorter than
        the train can achieve.
