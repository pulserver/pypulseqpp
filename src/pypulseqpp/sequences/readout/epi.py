    """One RF event followed by an EPI train with a fixed phase-encode pattern.

    The scan loop sets the shot origin by scaling prewinders. Blips implement
    the relative offsets and share the readout ramps; flyback blips instead
    play in the rewind gaps. TE is measured to the first echo, not the echo
    that acquires central phase encoding.

    Attributes
    ----------
    rf : RfEvent
        The excitation.
    gz : GradEvent
        Its selection gradient, if one was given.
    gz_reph : GradEvent
        Its rephaser, if one was given.
    gx_pre : TrapEvent
        Read prewinder, half a line lobe against the first line's polarity.
    gx : list of GradEvent
        One read lobe per line: alternating polarity for a blipped train, the
        same lobe every time for a flyback one.
    gx_flyback : TrapEvent
        The rewind between two lines. ``flyback`` only.
    gy_blips, gz_blips : list
        One phase-encode event per line, or ``None`` where no step is asked
        for, always ``etl`` long. A blipped train's entry carries the second
        half of the step into the line and the first half of the next out of
        it; a flyback train's is the whole step, played in the rewind block
        *after* that line, so its last entry is always ``None``.
        ``gz_blips`` is 3D only.
    gy_pre, gz_pre : TrapEvent
        Phase encodes at their largest step, to be scaled per shot. ``gz_pre``
        is 3D only.
    gy_rew, gz_rew : TrapEvent
        The encodes negated, in the block that closes the repetition.
    gx_spoil : GradEvent
        The lobe that closes the read axis, bridged off the last line.
    adc : AdcEvent
        The acquisition window, shared by every line.
    shot_labels : tuple of LabelEvent
        ``SET`` counters on the prewinder block, one per name in ``labels``.
        The loop writes the shot's origin into them. Always a tuple, however
        many names there are, because the loop splats it.
    line_labels : tuple of tuple of LabelEvent
        Per line, the ``INC`` counters that step from the previous line to this
        one -- the ordering, expressed as labels. Empty for the first line,
        which the ``SET`` already placed.
    order : numpy.ndarray
        ``(etl, 2)`` integer ``(ky, kz)`` offsets from the shot's origin.
    wait_te : DelayEvent
        Present only when a TE longer than the minimum was asked for.
    wait_tr : DelayEvent
        Present only when a TR longer than the minimum was asked for.
    etl : int
        Lines per repetition.
    esp : float
        Echo spacing (s).
    echo_times : numpy.ndarray
        Each line's echo time (s) from the excitation isodelay.
    echo_time : float
        The first line's, which is what ``te`` sets.
    bandwidth_hz : float
        Achieved ADC sampling rate (Hz).
    n_samples : int
        Samples per line.
    delta_kx : float
        Read-axis k-space step (1/m).
    blip_span : float
        Time one phase-encode step takes (s). It is paid out of the read ramps.

    Parameters
    ----------
    system : pypulseq.Opts
        System limits.
    rf : RfEvent
        The pulse that opens the repetition. A refocusing pulse builds the
        readout half of a spin-echo EPI.
    gz : GradEvent, optional
        A selection gradient played in the same block as ``rf``.
    gz_reph : GradEvent, optional
        The rephaser that unwinds ``gz``.
    fov : float or sequence of float
        Field of view (m), per encoded axis, readout first.
    matrix : int or sequence of int
        Matrix size, per encoded axis.
    order : array_like, optional
        ``(etl,)`` or ``(etl, 2)`` integer offsets from the shot's origin, one
        row per line. Supplying one silences the generator arguments below; the
        default asks :func:`~pypulseqpp.calc_epi_order` for a train.
    etl : int, optional
        Lines per repetition. Defaults to what one shot of the requested
        scheme needs to cross the phase-encode matrix.
    scheme : {'linear', 'caipi', 'zigzag'}, optional
        Which built-in ordering to generate. See
        :func:`~pypulseqpp.calc_epi_order`.
    acceleration, segments, partition_acceleration, caipi_shift, extent
        Passed to :func:`~pypulseqpp.calc_epi_order`.
    te : float, optional
        Excitation isodelay to the **first** echo (s). ``None`` is as short as
        possible; every other echo follows at ``esp`` intervals, and
        ``echo_times`` lists them.
    tr : float, optional
        Repetition time (s), over the whole module.
    oversampling : float, optional
        Read oversampling.
    readout_bandwidth_hz : float, optional
        Requested ADC sampling rate (Hz). ``bandwidth_hz`` reports the
        achieved raster-compatible rate.
    ramp_sampling : bool, optional
        Sample across the read ramps as well as the plateau, which is what
        makes the echo spacing short. Turn it off for a rectangular window at
        the cost of a longer train.
    flyback : bool, optional
        Read every line in the same direction, rewinding between them, instead
        of alternating polarity. It costs a rewind per line and buys away the
        odd-even inconsistency that a bipolar train leaves behind.
    spoiling_cycles : float, optional
        Read-axis spoiling at the end of the repetition, in cycles across
        ``voxel_size_m``.
    voxel_size_m : float, optional
        Length the spoiling is counted over (m). The read resolution by
        default.
    labels : sequence of str, optional
        Counters for the encoded axes, phase encode first. Two names for a 3D
        train, one for 2D.
    trigger : event, optional
        A trigger or digital output armed on the prewinder block.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If a count is out of range, ``order`` is the wrong shape or steps
        outside the matrix, ``labels`` does not name one counter per encoded
        axis, or the requested TE or TR is shorter than the train can achieve.
