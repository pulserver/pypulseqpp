    the half-flip pulse opposes the first excitation, and what ``ONCE`` marks.

    Attributes
    ----------
    rf : RfEvent
        The excitation, replayed every repetition with the phase and amplitude
        the loop sets.
    gz : GradEvent
        Its selection gradient, if one was given.
    gx_rew, gx : GradEvent
        The read lobe that closes a repetition and the one that opens the next.
        ``gx`` is prephaser and plateau in a single waveform.
    gy_pre, gy_rew : TrapEvent
        In-plane encode at its largest step, and the same negated, to be scaled
        per shot.
    gz_pre, gz_rew : TrapEvent
        The slice rephasers, one each side of the pulse. Absent for a hard
        pulse.
    gz_partition, gz_partition_rew : TrapEvent
        Partition encode at its largest step, and the same negated, each
        sharing a rephaser's window. 3D only; add one to a rephaser rather than
        playing it alone.
    adc : AdcEvent
        The acquisition window, spanning the readout plateau.
    adc_labels : LabelSetEvent or list of LabelSetEvent
        One per name in ``labels``; a bare event when there is one.
    prep_labels, train_labels, end_labels : list of LabelSetEvent
        ``ONCE`` set to 1, 0 and 2, marking the entry transient, the steady
        state and the ramp-down.
    wait_prep : DelayEvent
        What separates the half-flip pulse from the first excitation, so that
        interval is half a repetition. Absent under ``half_flip_prep=False``.
    wait_rewind : DelayEvent
        Stands in for the rewind block of the first repetition.
    tr, te : float
        Repetition and echo time (s); ``te`` is always half of ``tr``.
    bandwidth_hz : float
        Achieved receiver bandwidth.
    n_samples : int
        Samples per repetition.
    delta_kx : float
        Read-axis k-space step (1/m).
    readout_duration : float
        Sampling window (s).

    Parameters
    ----------
    system : pypulseq.Opts
        System limits.
    rf : RfEvent
        The excitation.
    gz : GradEvent, optional
        Its selection gradient, played in the excitation block. Nothing for a
        hard pulse. Pass an excitation built with ``rephase=False``: the
        rephasers belong to the balance condition and are built here.
    fov : float or sequence of float
        Field of view (m), per encoded axis, readout first.
    matrix : int or sequence of int
        Matrix size, per encoded axis.
    tr : float, optional
        Repetition time (s). ``None`` is as short as possible; a longer one is
        padded evenly either side of the echo, so TE stays at TR/2.
    half_flip_prep : bool, optional
        Publish ``wait_prep``, which needs half the acquisition window to be at
        least the excitation block's tail. Turn it off to ramp the train in
        with dummy repetitions instead.
    oversampling : float, optional
        Read oversampling.
    readout_bandwidth_hz : float, optional
        Requested receiver bandwidth. Read ``bandwidth_hz`` for what the two
        rasters allowed.
    labels : sequence of str, optional
        Counters emitted on the acquisition block.
    trigger : event, optional
        A trigger or digital output armed on the rewind block.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If a count is out of range, the acquisition window is shorter than
        twice the excitation block's tail, or the requested TR is shorter than
        the module can achieve.
