class _LineReadout(SequenceModule):
    """Cartesian line readout from the supplied RF event to the end of TR.

    An excitation produces a gradient echo; a refocusing event represents
    the readout half of a spin echo. Phase-encode templates require per-shot
    scaling.

    Zero spoiling balances the gradients. Positive spoiling after acquisition
    selects SSFP-FID; pre-acquisition spoiling selects SSFP-Echo. In the latter
    case the FID trajectory reported by calculate_kspace need not cross k=0;
    echo_time still describes the timing interval.

    Attributes
    ----------
    rf : RfEvent
        The pulse the module was given.
    gz : GradEvent
        Its selection gradient, if one was given.
    gz_reph : GradEvent
        Its rephaser, if one was given, left-aligned in whichever block follows
        the pulse.
    gx_pre : GradEvent
        Readout prephaser, right-aligned in the prewinder block.
    gx : GradEvent
        Readout lobe.
    gx_spoil : GradEvent
        The lobe that closes the TR on the readout axis: a pure rewinder when
        ``spoiling_cycles`` is zero, a bridged spoiler otherwise.
    gy_pre, gz_pre : TrapEvent
        Phase encodes at their largest step, to be scaled per shot. ``gz_pre``
        is 3D only.
    gy_rew, gz_rew : TrapEvent
        The negated encodes that unwind them, for a balanced TR.
    gx_flyback : TrapEvent
        Rewinder played between echoes of a monopolar train.
    gx_rev : GradEvent
        The negated lobe that reads the even echoes of a bipolar train.
    adc : AdcEvent
        The acquisition window, shared by every echo.
    adc_labels : LabelSetEvent or list of LabelSetEvent
        One per name in ``labels``, in order. Absent when ``labels`` is empty,
        and a bare event rather than a list when there is one.
    wait_te, wait_tr : DelayEvent
        Present only when a TE or TR longer than the minimum was asked for.

    Parameters
    ----------
    system : pypulseq.Opts
        System limits.
    rf : RfEvent
        The pulse that opens the repetition.
    gz : GradEvent, optional
        A selection gradient played in the same block as ``rf``. Pass an
        excitation's ``gz``, or nothing for a hard pulse.
    gz_reph : GradEvent, optional
        The rephaser that unwinds ``gz``. Pass a 2D excitation's ``gz_reph``
        and the readout carries it, left-aligned in the first block after the
        pulse so it runs straight off the selection lobe: the TE wait when
        there is one, the prewinder block otherwise. A slab excitation
        (``is_slab=True``) has already merged it into ``gz`` and passes
        nothing.
    fov : float or sequence of float
        Field of view (m), per encoded axis, readout first.
    matrix : int or sequence of int
        Matrix size per encoded axis, used to set gradient areas. The scan
        loop controls the number and order of acquired lines.
    te : float, optional
        Echo time (s), from the RF isodelay to the first echo. ``None`` is as
        short as possible.
    tr : float, optional
        Repetition time (s), over the whole module. ``None`` is as short as
        possible.
    partial_echo : float, optional
        Fraction of the full echo acquired, in ``(0.5, 1]``. Truncates the
        samples *before* the echo, so it shortens TE.
    oversampling : float, optional
        Readout oversampling. Densifies the sampling -- ``delta_kx`` shrinks
        and the sampled field of view grows -- while the k-space width, and so
        the resolution, is fixed by ``fov`` and ``matrix`` alone.
    readout_bandwidth_hz : float, optional
        Requested ADC sampling rate (Hz). ``bandwidth_hz`` reports the
        achieved rate, subject to both ADC and gradient raster constraints.
    spoiling_cycles : float, optional
        Residual dephasing left at the end of the TR, in cycles across
        ``voxel_size_m``. Zero is balanced.
    voxel_size_m : float, optional
        Length the spoiling is counted over (m). Defaults to the readout
        resolution.
    spoiling_position : {'post', 'pre'}, optional
        Which side of the acquisition the dephasing lobe sits on.
    n_echoes : int, optional
        Echoes per repetition.
    flyback : bool, optional
        With more than one echo: rewind between echoes so every one is read in
        the same direction (monopolar, the default), or alternate the readout
        sign (bipolar), which is faster but reads even echoes backwards and
        puts any gradient-delay error into a phase difference between them.
    labels : sequence of str, optional
        Counters emitted on the acquisition block. The loop writes the values.
    trigger : event, optional
        A trigger or digital output armed on the prewinder block.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If a count or a fraction is out of range, or the requested TE or TR is
        shorter than the module can achieve.
