class _RadialReadout(_ArmedReadout):
    """A full radial spoke, prephaser and rewinder merged into one waveform.

    Prephaser, traversal and rewinder are one continuous gradient, so the loop
    plays a spoke in a single ``add_block`` and one rotation event orients the
    whole thing. The ADC sits on the plateau. A slice rephaser rides the same
    block, on the axis the rotation turns about, so it comes back unturned::

        for angle in pp.calc_golden_angles(n_spokes):
            rotation = pp.make_rotation(Rotation.from_euler("z", angle))
            seq.add_block(readout.gx, readout.gz_reph, readout.adc, rotation)

    ``explicit=True`` with ``angles`` writes every spoke out instead, so ``gx``
    and ``gy`` come back as **lists** -- one registered waveform per spoke,
    which is what the rotation extension exists to avoid.

    Attributes
    ----------
    rf : RfEvent
        The pulse the module was given.
    gz : GradEvent
        Its selection gradient, if one was given.
    gz_reph : GradEvent
        Its rephaser, if one was given, left-aligned in whichever block follows
        the pulse.
    gx, gy : GradEvent
        The spoke, prephaser through rewinder. ``gy`` is the same waveform at
        zero amplitude, so a block always has a y slot for a rotation to fill.
        Lists of one entry per angle when ``explicit``.
    gz_pre, gz_rew : TrapEvent
        Partition encode and its rewinder. Stacks only.
    gz_spoil : GradEvent
        End-of-TR spoiler, when ``spoiling_cycles`` is nonzero.
    adc : AdcEvent
        The acquisition window, delayed onto the readout plateau.
    adc_labels : LabelSetEvent or list of LabelSetEvent
        One per name in ``labels``; a bare event when there is one.
    wait_te, wait_tr : DelayEvent
        Present only when a TE or TR longer than the minimum was asked for.
    echo_spacing : float
        Time between consecutive echoes (s), zero for a single-echo readout.

    Parameters
    ----------
    system : pypulseq.Opts
        System limits.
    rf : RfEvent
        The pulse that opens the repetition.
    gz : GradEvent, optional
        A selection gradient played in the same block as ``rf``.
    gz_reph : GradEvent, optional
        The rephaser that unwinds ``gz``. Carried left-aligned in the first
        block after the pulse -- the TE wait when there is one, otherwise
        alongside the prephaser at the head of the spoke, where it costs no
        echo time at all. Only an axis the loop's rotation leaves alone can
        carry one, so an in-plane acquisition takes a rephaser on z and a
        projection takes none.
    fov : float
        Isotropic in-plane field of view (m).
    matrix : int
        In-plane matrix size. Sets ``kmax = matrix / (2 * fov)``.
    fov_z, matrix_z : float, int
        Partition field of view (m) and count. Stacks only.
    te, tr : float, optional
        Echo time (s) from the RF isodelay to the centre crossing, and
        repetition time (s). ``None`` is as short as possible.
    oversampling : float, optional
        Readout oversampling: more samples along the same spoke.
    readout_bandwidth_hz : float, optional
        Requested receiver bandwidth. Read ``bandwidth_hz`` for what the two
        rasters actually allowed.
    spoiling_cycles : float, optional
        Dephasing left at the end of the TR, in cycles across
        ``voxel_size_m``. Zero leaves the spoke rewound.
    voxel_size_m : float, optional
        Length the spoiling is counted over (m); the resolution by default.
    spoiling_axis : {'z', 'x', 'y'}, optional
        Axis the spoiler is played on.
    n_echoes : int, optional
        Times the path is replayed per repetition. Every echo traverses the
        same k, so the train is one trajectory at a series of echo times: a
        spoke is prephaser-through-rewinder in one waveform and already comes
        back, and an arm that does not is bracketed between echoes by its own
        rewinder and prewinder. ``echo_spacing`` is what separates them, and
        each acquisition carries its own ``ECO``: a scan loop hands over a
        whole arm, so the echo boundaries inside it are the readout's to count.
    explicit : bool, optional
        Write out one spoke per entry of ``angles`` instead of one base spoke.
    angles : array-like, optional
        In-plane rotations (rad). Required when ``explicit``, refused
        otherwise -- a sampling pattern is not the readout's to hold.
    labels : sequence of str, optional
        Counters emitted on the acquisition block.
    trigger : event, optional
        A trigger or digital output armed on the block that opens the readout.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If a count is out of range, ``angles`` and ``explicit`` disagree, or
        the requested TE or TR is shorter than the module can achieve.

class NonCartesianReadout(_ArmedReadout):
    """A solved interleave, bracketed by the bridges that reach it and leave it.

    Where a radial spoke is one continuous lobe, a spiral or a rosette is a
    waveform solved against the vector limits, and whichever of its endpoints
    is away from k = 0 needs a bridge of its own. So the repetition is the
    pulse, a prewinder block when the path does not start at the centre, the
    acquisition, and a rewinder block when it does not end there.

    Subclass this to add a family: design a :class:`NonCartesianGradient` and
    hand it over. Everything below -- the bracket alignment, the TE and TR
    budget, the spoiler, the ``explicit`` path -- is inherited, and the events
    a subclass builds are published alongside the ones built here.

    Orientation is the loop's business; see :class:`_RadialReadout` for the
    two ways to apply it, which are the same here.

    Attributes
    ----------
    rf : RfEvent
        The pulse the module was given.
    gz : GradEvent
        Its selection gradient, if one was given.
    gz_reph : GradEvent
        Its rephaser, if one was given, left-aligned in whichever block follows
        the pulse.
    gx, gy : GradEvent
        The interleave. Lists of one entry per angle when ``explicit``.
    gx_pre, gy_pre : GradEvent
        Bridges reaching the start of the path, when it is not k = 0.
    gx_rew, gy_rew : GradEvent
        Bridges returning to k = 0, when the path does not end there.
    gz_pre, gz_rew : TrapEvent
        Partition encode and its rewinder. Stacks only.
    gz_spoil : GradEvent
        End-of-TR spoiler, when ``spoiling_cycles`` is nonzero.
    adc : AdcEvent
        The acquisition window.
    adc_labels : LabelSetEvent or list of LabelSetEvent
        One per name in ``labels``; a bare event when there is one.
    wait_te, wait_tr : DelayEvent
        Present only when a TE or TR longer than the minimum was asked for.
    trajectory : NonCartesianGradient
        The designed interleave, for its ``trajectory`` array and timings.
    echo_spacing : float
        Time between consecutive echoes (s), zero for a single-echo readout.

    Parameters
    ----------
    Shared with :class:`_RadialReadout`, except that the interleave arrives as
    ``trajectory`` rather than being built from ``fov`` and ``matrix``.

    Examples
    --------
    A family is a trajectory and nothing else: design one, hand it over, and
    the bracket alignment, the TE and TR budget, the spoiler and the
    explicit-rotation path are inherited.
