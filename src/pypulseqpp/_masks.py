    """Return the sampled view indices for uniform undersampling + ACS block.

    Every ``r``-th view is sampled, plus a centered block of ``acs_lines``
    autocalibration views.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n : int
        Total number of views.
    r : int
        Acceleration factor (view ``i`` is sampled when ``i % r == 0``).
    acs_lines : int
        Number of fully sampled center views.
    order : str, optional
        ``'ascending'`` traverses k-space from one edge to the other.
        ``'calibration_first'`` puts the autocalibration block ahead of
        everything else, so a reconstruction can estimate coil sensitivities
        from it while the remaining views are still being acquired. It acquires
        the centre of k-space before the magnetisation has reached steady
        state, so a sequence using it wants dummy repetitions first. Default is
        ``'ascending'``.
    partial_fourier : float, optional
        Fraction of the phase-encode extent acquired, in ``(0.5, 1]``. The
        views dropped are the leading ones, so the centre stays in and the
        conjugate symmetry of k-space covers what is missing. It applies to
        the calibration block as well: a view that is not played is not in the
        list, whatever else would have asked for it. Default is 1.0.

    Returns
    -------
    list of int
        Sampled view indices, in acquisition order.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError

    The 3D counterpart of :func:`calc_sampled_lines`: a CAIPIRINHA lattice
    (:func:`make_caipirinha_mask`) on the two phase-encode axes, a fully
    sampled autocalibration *rectangle* at the centre of k-space, and partial
    Fourier on either axis. ``caipi_shift`` is the per-``ky``-block shift the
    lattice applies along kz; ``0`` degenerates to a plain ``r_y x r_z``
    grid. ``elliptical`` drops the pairs outside the inscribed ``ky``-``kz``
    ellipse -- the corners a Cartesian grid samples but a round object never
    fills -- which is a disk when ``n_y == n_z``.

    ``'calibration_first'`` leads the traversal with the rectangle -- every
    sampled pair whose line *and* partition are both autocalibration views --
    partitions outer and lines inner, then the remaining pairs in the same
    nesting. This is what lets a reconstruction calibrate the moment the
    rectangle is complete rather than at the end of the scan. The rectangle is
    carved out explicitly because a product of two per-axis calibration-first
    orders would interleave autocalibration and non-autocalibration pairs.

    Parameters
    ----------
    shape : tuple of int
        ``(n_y, n_z)``, the phase-encode and partition-encode counts.
    acceleration : tuple of int
        ``(r_y, r_z)``, the uniform undersampling factor on each axis.
    calibration : tuple of int
        ``(acs_y, acs_z)``, the autocalibration extent on each axis, in views.
    partial_fourier : tuple of float, optional
        ``(pf_y, pf_z)``, the acquired fraction of each axis in ``(0.5, 1]``.
        Default is ``(1.0, 1.0)``.
    caipi_shift : int, optional
        CAIPIRINHA shift along kz per sampled-ky block, ``0 <= caipi_shift <
        r_z``. ``0`` (the default) is a regular lattice; a non-zero shift
        spreads the aliasing into both phase-encode directions. Default is 0.
    elliptical : bool, optional
        Restrict the sampled support to the inscribed ``(ky, kz)`` ellipse,
        dropping the corners of k-space a round object never occupies. The
        autocalibration rectangle, being central, is kept whatever this is.
        ``False`` samples the full rectangle, which costs the corners' scan
        time for resolution along the diagonals no anatomy has. Default is
        True.
    order : str, optional
        ``'calibration_first'`` (the default) leads with the rectangle;
        ``'ascending'`` traverses the whole grid partitions-outer,
        lines-inner without pulling the rectangle forward.

    Returns
    -------
    pairs : list of tuple of int
        ``(line, partition)`` in acquisition order.
    n_calibration : int
        How many leading pairs make up the autocalibration rectangle. With
        ``order='ascending'`` this still reports the rectangle's size, though
        those pairs are not contiguous at the front.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``order`` is not one of the two recognised values, or a
        ``partial_fourier`` entry is outside ``(0.5, 1]``.

    Examples
    --------

    train_length : int
        Echo-train or segment length.
    center : tuple of float or None, optional
        The k-space centre the target echo is placed on. ``None`` uses the
        centroid of ``coords``; a caller with a fixed grid passes its centre.
    center_echo : int or None, optional
        Echo the k-space centre is acquired at. ``None`` leaves the raster

        so the one holding the centre plays at that echo -- the effective-TE

        When True every train is padded to ``train_length`` with ``None`` so
        the echo index is the position in the train; when False (the default)

    """Center-out radial (wedge) echo-train ordering.

    k-space is partitioned into angular wedges (one per shot). Within each
    wedge the views are ordered by radial distance from the k-space center,
    so every echo train samples the center first and the periphery last —
    scheme B ("radial wedge reordering") of 566-05-007, Fig. 2, and the
    conventional proton-density 3D FSE center-out ordering (Busse et al.).
    The centre of k-space is therefore always at the first echo.

    Parameters
    ----------
    coords : array_like
        Phase-encode locations, shape ``(N,)`` or ``(N, 2)``.
    train_length : int
        Echo-train or segment length; the number of wedges is
        ``ceil(N / train_length)``.
    center : tuple of float or None, optional
        k-space centre; ``None`` uses the centroid of ``coords``.
    pad : bool, optional
        Pad each train to ``train_length`` with ``None`` (see
        :func:`make_linear_order`).

    Returns
    -------
    list of list of int
        Shots of view indices, each ordered center-out.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np

    >>> shots = pp.make_radial_order(coords, 5)
    >>> all(len(s) <= 5 for s in shots)
