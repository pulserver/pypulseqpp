def calc_golden_angles(n: int, *, full_circle: bool = False) -> np.ndarray:
    """Return ``n`` golden-angle spoke rotations, in radians.

    Consecutive spokes advance by a golden increment, so any contiguous
    temporal window of spokes stays near-uniformly distributed — the property
    that makes golden-angle ordering the default for retrospectively binned and
    free-breathing acquisitions.

    Two conventions, selected by ``full_circle``, for the two geometries a
    rotated readout comes in. A diametric spoke -- a radial line, a PROPELLER
    blade -- is ``pi``-periodic, so its golden angle is the MRI golden angle
    ``pi / phi`` (111.25 degrees; Winkelmann). A one-sided arm -- a spiral
    interleaf -- covers the whole turn, so its golden angle is the classic
    full-circle ``2 * pi / phi**2`` (137.51 degrees).

    A flat angle array, accumulated modulo ``2 * pi``: index it per shot,
    pair it with a base waveform and
    :func:`pypulseqpp.make_rotation`. Use :func:`make_radial_tilt` when
    the angular period or the segmentation matters.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n : int
        Number of angles.
    full_circle : bool, optional
        ``False`` (the default) is the ``pi``-periodic radial/blade golden
        angle ``pi / phi``; ``True`` is the full-turn spiral golden angle
        ``2 * pi / phi**2``. Default is False.

    Returns
    -------
    numpy.ndarray
        Angles (rad), length ``n``, accumulated modulo ``2 pi``.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> import pypulseqpp as pp
    >>> np.rad2deg(pp.calc_golden_angles(4)).round(2)
    array([  0.  , 111.25, 222.49, 333.74])

    The full-circle convention advances by the classic 137.51-degree golden
    angle instead:

    >>> np.rad2deg(pp.calc_golden_angles(3, full_circle=True)).round(2)
    array([  0.  , 137.51, 275.02])

    Where each increment puts the first 34 spokes — golden angle spreads them in any window, tiny golden angle does the same in smaller steps, RAGA snaps them to a fixed equidistant support:

    """Return ``n`` RAGA (rational approximate golden-angle) spoke rotations.

    RAGA replaces the irrational golden increment with the nearest Fibonacci
    ratio, so the angular *support* is finite and exactly equidistant while
    the temporal index order stays golden-like. Every bin of a binned
    reconstruction therefore draws from the same fixed angle set, which is
    what makes RAGA reproducible bin to bin where plain golden angle is not.

    The support holds ``fib(approximation_order, tiny_index)`` distinct
    angles; ``n`` may exceed that, in which case angles repeat.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n : int
        Number of angles.
    tiny_index : int, optional
        Tiny-golden index the rational approximation is built from.

    ``span`` selects the geometry the same way ``full_circle`` does for the
    golden angle: ``pi`` spreads ``pi``-periodic diametric spokes (radial
    lines, PROPELLER blades) over a half turn, and the default ``2 * pi``
    spreads one-sided arms (spiral interleaves) over the whole turn.

    A continuous-gradient readout writes its shell out as one waveform and
    cannot afford one per shot, so the sphere is covered by rotating that
    shell. The shell runs from ``+z`` to ``-z``, visiting every polar ring
    once, so turning it about ``z`` by ``2 * pi / n_shots`` puts ``n_shots``
    evenly spaced spokes on each ring: full coverage, and every shot congruent
    with every other.

    Consecutive views inside the shell subtend a **constant angle**, so every
    turn between them asks the amplifier for the same slew. The repetition
    time has to hold the widest turn, and a constant step is what stops the
    other turns wasting it.

    The two poles are the exception -- they sit on the rotation axis, so all
    shots share them.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_views : int
        Spokes in the base shell, at least three.
    n_shots : int, optional
        Rotated replays of that shell.
    scheme : {'spiral', 'meridian'}, optional
        ``'spiral'`` winds pole to pole across equal-area rings, so the shell
        alone is already near-uniform. ``'meridian'`` is a half great circle in
        the x-z plane at equal polar steps, which is simpler and oversamples
        the poles.

    Returns
    -------
    directions : numpy.ndarray
        Unit spoke directions of the base shell, shape ``(n_views, 3)``.
    rotations : numpy.ndarray
        Rotation matrices, shape ``(n_shots, 3, 3)``, each turning the whole
        shell to where that shot samples.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If a count is out of range or ``scheme`` is unknown.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np

    >>> directions.shape, rotations.shape
    ((32, 3), (13, 3, 3))

    The shell runs pole to pole, so the shot rotations leave its ends alone:

    >>> bool(np.allclose(directions[[0, -1]], [[0, 0, 1], [0, 0, -1]]))
    True

    Consecutive views are exactly one step apart, so every turn between them
    is the same slew:
