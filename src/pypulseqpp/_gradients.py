"""Gradient factories stated in imaging terms rather than in area.

Each is a thin wrapper over one of PyPulseq's own factories, taking the
quantity a sequence actually knows -- a resolution, a field of view, cycles of
dephasing across a voxel -- and doing the one division that turns it into an
area.

    """Lay gradients on one channel end to end and sum them into one event.

    Each gradient after the first is delayed to begin where the previous one
    ends, so the result plays them back to back on the shared channel. This is
    what folds a slice rephaser onto its selection gradient -- exactly what a
    slab excitation does internally -- so a spectral-spatial or multiband pulse,
    whose rephaser is a separate event, can hand a 3D or SMS readout one merged
    ``z`` lobe rather than a second gradient the readout has no block for. The
    inputs are not modified; ``None`` entries are dropped.

    Parameters
    ----------
    *grads : GradEvent or TrapEvent or None
        Gradients on the **same** channel, in play order. ``None`` is skipped.
    system : pypulseq.Opts, optional
        System limits.

    Returns
    -------
    GradEvent
        The gradients concatenated into a single event, or the sole gradient
        unchanged when only one is given.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If no gradient is given, or they are not all on one channel.

    Examples
    --------

    """Encode one phase-encode axis at full amplitude, for a target resolution.

    The largest phase-encode step an acquisition needs is set by resolution
    alone: index ``i`` of ``n`` encodes area ``(i - n/2) / fov``, so the extreme
    is ``(n/2) / fov``, and since ``resolution = fov / n`` that is
    ``1 / (2 * resolution)``. Field of view and matrix size cancel, so neither
    is asked for.

    This builds **one** gradient. Which views are played, and in what order, is
    a scan loop's business; scale this template per view.

    Parameters
    ----------
    channel : str
        Gradient channel (``"x"``, ``"y"`` or ``"z"``).
    resolution : float
        Target resolution along ``channel`` (m) -- ``fov / matrix`` for an
        in-plane encode, the partition spacing for a 3D slab encode.
    system : pypulseq.Opts, optional
        System limits.
    duration : float, optional
        Force a duration (s); the default is the shortest feasible.

    Returns
    -------
    TrapEvent
        Trapezoid of area ``1 / (2 * resolution)``, to be
        :func:`~pypulseq.scale_grad`-ed per view.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``resolution`` is not positive.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import pypulseqpp as pp
    >>> gy = pp.make_phase_encoding("y", 0.22 / 64, system=pp.Opts())
    >>> round(gy.area, 3)

    The same call encodes a 3D slab's partitions, the resolution along ``z``
