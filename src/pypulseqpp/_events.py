"""PyPulseq's event factories, returning events with their fields in slots.

Every ``make_*`` here is upstream's, wrapped: it builds the event exactly as
PyPulseq does -- same validation, same defaults, same bug fixes when upstream
ships them -- and the result is converted once into a C++ object whose fields
are offsets rather than dictionary entries.

That conversion is the whole trick. Reading a ``SimpleNamespace`` costs a
dictionary lookup per field, which is unremarkable until a three-dimensional
protocol reads tens of millions of them; on a 512x1024x512 MPRAGE it is about
half the time spent building the sequence.

The objects that come back quack like the namespaces they replace. ``rf.signal``
is the complex waveform at its real amplitude and ``grad.waveform`` the scaled
samples, both rebuilt on demand, so anything downstream that reads an event --
including PyPulseq's own plotting and k-space code -- keeps working.

**Scaling is one number.** RF and arbitrary gradients are stored as a
normalised shape beside a scalar amplitude, which is how the file stores them
too. So::

    rf.amplitude *= 0.5          # one write; the registered shape still stands

is not merely faster than rescaling the samples, it is *better*: a variable
flip angle train is one magnitude shape at many amplitudes, and this is what
lets it be registered once. Assigning to ``signal`` or ``waveform`` outright
re-normalises and drops the registration, because that really is a new
waveform.

Setters do not re-validate. ``make_*`` checked the event when it built it, and
a loop moving a phase encode from one line to the next is not making a new
claim about the hardware.
