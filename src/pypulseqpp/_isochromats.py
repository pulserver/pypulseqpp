class Isochromats:
    """Isochromats, and the magnetisation the Bloch equation carries from one block to the next.

    The magnetisation turns about the field ``b = (Re b1, Im b1, bz)``, in Hz,
    in the frame rotating at the reference frequency, as the magnetic moment
    of a nucleus of positive gyromagnetic ratio precesses: ``dM/dt = 2 pi M x
    b``, clockwise seen from the tip of ``b``. A 90 degree pulse along ``+x``
    takes ``+z`` to ``+y``, and an isochromat at a positive off-resonance or
    along a positive gradient accrues ``Mx + i My`` a negative phase.

    Free precession under a piecewise-linear gradient, with relaxation, is
    integrated exactly and applied when the magnetisation is next needed. An
    RF pulse is a sequence of steps, each a rotation about the step's mean
    field between two half steps of relaxation; isochromats that see the same
    field during a pulse share its computation, and a pulse that differs from
    an earlier one by its phase alone, under the same gradient, reuses the
    earlier one's computation turned about z by that phase. A pulse played
    under no gradient or one held throughout it is computed on a grid of the
    field an isochromat sees and interpolated, to within about ``1e-7`` of the
    equilibrium magnetisation, wherever the grid costs fewer maps than the
    isochromats' groups: without transmit sensitivities, or with every channel
    playing one waveform times a weight of its own, when an isochromat's
    transmit field is that waveform times one complex drive, whose magnitude
    the grid spans too and whose phase turns the computation about z. An ADC
    window under a gradient held throughout it is read by a non-uniform FFT
    of the isochromats of each T2, to within about ``1e-13`` of the sum of
    the magnitudes of their transverse magnetisations times their receive
    sensitivities, wherever that costs less than turning every isochromat at
    every sample.

    Parameters
    ----------
    positions : array_like
        ``(n, 3)`` positions, in m, along the axes the gradients are played on.
    proton_density : float or array_like, default=1.0
        Equilibrium longitudinal magnetisation, per isochromat.
    t1, t2 : float or array_like, default=inf
        Relaxation times, in s; ``inf`` for none.
    off_resonance : float or array_like, default=0.0
        Precession frequency at rest, in Hz from the reference frequency:
        field inhomogeneity and chemical shift together.
    transmit : array_like, default=None
        Complex transmit sensitivities, ``(n,)`` or ``(n, channels)``, scaling
        the field of each RF channel. By default one channel of unit
        sensitivity, onto which the channels of a pTx pulse are summed.
    receive : array_like, default=None
        Complex receive sensitivities, ``(n,)`` or ``(n, coils)``. By default
        one coil of unit sensitivity. A C-contiguous complex128 array, a
        memory-mapped one included, is read in place into the isochromats'
        own layout, so that it is never copied whole into memory.
    threads : int, default=0
        Worker threads; 0 for every core.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If a property has the wrong shape or is not finite, or a relaxation
        time is not positive.

    Notes
    -----
    Every isochromat starts at equilibrium, along ``+z``. The engine computes
    what the sequence does to these isochromats; it does not model the
    scanner's hardware, diffusion, flow or motion.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> import pypulseqpp as pp
    >>> spins = pp.Isochromats([[0.0, 0.0, 0.0]], t2=0.1)

    A 25 kHz field along ``+x`` held for 10 us turns ``+z`` by 90 degrees,
    to ``+y``; the transverse magnetisation then decays with ``t2``:

    >>> pulse = (0.0, 10e-6, [25e3])
    >>> signal = spins.play(10.01e-3, rf=pulse, adc=[10e-6, 10.01e-3])

        Parameters
        ----------
        duration : float
            Block duration, in s.
        gradients : sequence, default=None
            Three entries, for the x, y and z axes, each ``None`` or a
            ``(2, m)`` array of corner times over gradient amplitude, in Hz/m.
            The gradient is linear between the corners and zero outside them.
        rotation : array_like, default=None
            ``(3, 3)`` matrix from the axes ``gradients`` are given along to
            the axes of the positions, a reflection allowed. Each axis plays
            the sum its row weights, exact on the union of the corners, with
            a gradient's step from or to zero at its first or last corner
            kept as a step.
        rf : RF event or tuple, default=None
            An RF event: ``signal``, in Hz, at the times ``t`` from the pulse's
            start, which is ``delay`` into the block, with its phase and
            frequency offsets; a dynamic pTx pulse holds its channels one
            after another over one time base. Or the transverse field ``b1``,
            as ``(start, step, samples)``: ``(steps,)`` or
            ``(channels, steps)`` complex samples, in Hz, each held for
            ``step`` from ``start`` on. Without transmit sensitivities the
            channels are summed; with them there must be one channel each.
        adc : ADC event or array_like, default=None
            An ADC event, sampled at the middle of each dwell from its delay
            on, whose samples are returned demodulated by its phase offset,
            frequency offset and phase modulation. Or increasing sample
            times, whose samples are returned as received. No sample may fall
            inside the RF pulse.
        system : Opts, default=None
            The RF raster, over whose steps an RF event with a time shape is
            held, and the gamma and B0 the events' ppm offsets are resolved
            at; the default system when None.

        Returns
        -------
        NDArray[np.complex128]
            ``(coils, samples)``: at each sample, the sum over the isochromats of
            the receive sensitivity times ``Mx + i My``, demodulated for an ADC
            event.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If an event does not fit in the block, an ADC sample falls inside
            the RF pulse, the RF channels do not match the transmit
            sensitivities, or an event or the rotation is malformed.

        Repetition ``n`` plays ``blocks`` with every RF event's phase offset

        One repetition applies an affine map to each isochromat's

            ``rotation``, ``rf`` and ``adc``. Every window must be read under
            a gradient held throughout it, its samples on one side of any RF
            pulse in its block.
        phases : array_like
            ``(repetitions,)`` increase of every RF event's phase offset, in
            rad.
        areas : array_like, default=None
            ``(repetitions, windows, 3)`` phase-encoding area at each window's
            first sample, in 1/m, along the axes the positions are given
            along; none by default.
        adc_phases : array_like, default=None
            ``(repetitions,)`` increase of every ADC event's phase offset, in
            rad; ``phases`` by default.
        system : Opts, default=None
            As :meth:`play` takes it.
        tolerance : float, default=0.0
            Accuracy of the samples, relative to the sum of the magnitudes of
            the terms each sums; exact to rounding at zero. Above zero, the
            windows are read by a kernel just wide enough for it, and from
            1e-4 on the magnetisation is carried in single precision. Where,
            besides, the phases step by one increment, to within 1e-4 rad,
            and the phase encodings run along at most two axes along which the
            isochromats take few coordinates, as on a lattice, each
            isochromat's magnetisation is split into its fixed point under the
            mean increment and a transient about it: the fixed points' samples
            are summed over the columns of isochromats that share their
            coordinates along those axes, and an isochromat whose transient
            falls below ``tolerance`` times its proton density stands at its
            fixed point from then on.

        Returns
        -------
        Repetitions
            The repetitions, which play in turn; the isochromats hold the
            magnetisation at the start of the next to be played.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If the phases, ADC phases and areas do not describe one set of
            repetitions, a window is not read under a held gradient, or a
            block is one :meth:`play` would refuse.
