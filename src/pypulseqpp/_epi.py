"""Within-shot echo orderings for EPI trains.

An EPI shot walks a fixed pattern of phase-encode steps and repeats it every
repetition, shifted bodily to wherever that shot samples. These build the
pattern: offsets from the shot's own origin, one row per echo.

    """Phase-encode offsets an EPI shot visits, relative to where it starts.

    The first row is always ``(0, 0)``: the pattern says where the shot goes
    *from* its origin, and placing that origin is the scan loop's job. The
    second column is the partition offset, zero throughout for the schemes
    that do not encode one.

    Parameters
    ----------
    etl : int
        Echoes in the train.
    scheme : {'linear', 'caipi', 'zigzag'}, optional
        ``'linear'`` steps by ``segments * acceleration`` every echo and never
        leaves its partition -- plain segmented EPI, and plain single-shot EPI
        at the defaults. ``'caipi'`` adds the partition sawtooth that turns
        that into segmented blipped-CAIPI. ``'zigzag'`` walks up and down a
        phase-encode segment instead of across the whole matrix, which is what
        lets a shot sample the same lines at many echo times.
    acceleration : int, optional
        Phase-encode undersampling, ``Ry``: lines the blip skips.
    segments : int, optional
        Shots the train is interleaved across, ``S``. The blip becomes
        ``S * Ry``, which shortens the train and widens the phase-encode
        bandwidth without changing the lattice sampled.
    partition_acceleration : int, optional
        Partition undersampling ``Rz``, the height of the CAIPI cycle.
        ``'caipi'`` only.
    caipi_shift : int, optional
        Partitions the pattern climbs per acquired line, ``delta_z``.
        ``'caipi'`` only.
    extent : int, optional
        Phase-encode lines one pass spans, ``R_seg``. Required by
        ``'zigzag'``, refused by the others.

    Returns
    -------
    numpy.ndarray
        ``(etl, 2)`` integer ``(ky, kz)`` offsets from the shot's origin.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If a count is out of range, ``scheme`` is unknown, or ``extent`` is
        given for a scheme that has no use for it and vice versa.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import pypulseqpp as pp
    >>> pp.calc_epi_order(4, acceleration=2)[:, 0]
    array([0, 2, 4, 6])

    Segmenting widens the blip without moving the lattice, so two shots of
    three cover what one shot of six did:

    >>> pp.calc_epi_order(3, acceleration=2, segments=2)[:, 0]
    array([0, 4, 8])

    A CAIPI shell climbs the partitions and wraps, which is what makes the
    partition blips take only two values:

    >>> order = pp.calc_epi_order(6, scheme="caipi", partition_acceleration=3)
    >>> order[:, 1]
    array([0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2])

    A zigzag turns inside its segment, and the return pass is offset by half a
    blip so it samples between the outward one:

    >>> pp.calc_epi_order(9, scheme="zigzag", acceleration=4, extent=12)[:, 0]
    array([ 0,  4,  8, 12, 10,  6,  2,  0,  4])
