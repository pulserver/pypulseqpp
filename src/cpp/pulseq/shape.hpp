/**
 * @file shape.hpp
 * @brief Pulseq's shape codec: run-length encoding of the derivative.
 *
 * A gradient or pulse shape is stored in a `.seq` file compressed, and the
 * scheme is chosen for what MR waveforms actually look like: a constant run
 * and a linear ramp both differentiate to one repeated number, so a trapezoid
 * of ten thousand samples is a handful of them.
 *
 * Compression is not free -- it is a pass over every sample, with a
 * quantisation and a correction term -- which is why it belongs *here*, at the
 * end, rather than where a shape is registered.  A scan that registers a
 * waveform per shot registers hundreds of thousands of them and keeps a few:
 * compressing on the way in pays for every candidate, compressing on the way
 * out pays only for the survivors.
