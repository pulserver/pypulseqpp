/**
 * @file events.hpp
 * @brief The events a block is made of, held the way a sequence wants them.
 *
 * PyPulseq's `make_*` functions hand back a `SimpleNamespace`, and reading one
 * costs a dictionary lookup per field.  That is fine once; it is not fine two
 * million times, which is what building a three-dimensional protocol does.
 * These are the same events with the fields in slots.
 *
 * ### Waveforms are stored normalised
 *
 * An RF pulse is kept as a magnitude in 0..1, a phase in turns, and one scalar
 * amplitude; an arbitrary gradient as a normalised waveform and one scalar.
 * That is exactly how the file stores them -- the `[SHAPES]` entry is
 * normalised and the amplitude lives in the event row -- so nothing is being
 * transformed for our convenience.
 *
 * What it buys is that **scaling a pulse is one number**.  A variable flip
 * angle train is the same magnitude shape at a hundred amplitudes, and with
 * this layout it registers that shape once and writes a hundred rows that
 * differ in a single column.  Scaling the samples instead would make a hundred
 * shapes that deduplication then has to discover are related, having already
 * paid to store them.
 *
 * ### Registered ids ride along
 *
 * Once a waveform has been registered with a sequence, its shape ids are kept
 * here so the next block that plays it does not go looking again -- which is
 * what Pulseq's own `registerGradEvent` does with `event.shapeIDs`.  The
 * difference is the `owner` stamp: ids are only reused for the sequence that
 * issued them, so the same event played into a second sequence registers
 * afresh instead of pointing at a shape that sequence has never heard of.
