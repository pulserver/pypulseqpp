/**
 * @file dedup.cpp
 * @brief Sequence::remove_duplicates() -- collapse every library onto its
 *        distinct rows and renumber everything that points at them.
 *
 * ### What decides that two events are one event
 *
 * The precision the `.seq` file writes the column at, and nothing else.  A
 * trapezoid's amplitude is written `%12g`, so two amplitudes agreeing to six
 * significant digits are written identically and cannot be two rows; its ramp
 * times are written as whole microseconds, so two delays agreeing to 1e-6 s
 * are the same delay.  Rounding to that precision therefore costs nothing --
 * the file could not have carried the difference -- and it is what turns the
 * six million gradient rows of a 3D protocol into the couple of thousand the
 * scan actually plays.
 *
 * A profile entry is *significant digits* when positive and *decimal places*
 * when zero or negative.  The distinction is about units: significant-digit
 * rounding is scale invariant, so a column stored in seconds and written in
 * microseconds may use it, while a column whose file precision is absolute
 * (a delay quantised to the microsecond, a dwell time to the nanosecond) has
 * to name decimal places in the unit the library holds -- SI.
 *
 * The rounded row is what survives.  That is not a detail: were the original
 * kept, a sequence written and read back would hold different numbers from the
 * one deduplicated here, and the second write would not match the first.
 *
 * ### Two deliberate differences from the Python this replaces
 *
 * The ADC library's shape reference rounds *exactly* rather than to six
 * significant digits.  It is an id, not a measurement, and at six digits a
 * sequence with more than 999999 shapes would have collapsed two different
 * ones onto each other.
 *
 * Negative zero is folded onto zero.  The two are the same number and differ
 * only in the bits a hash looks at, so a phase encode scaled by minus nothing
 * would otherwise be a row of its own.
 *
 * ### Order
 *
 * Bottom up: shapes first, then the events that name them, then the gradient
 * numbering that spans two of those, then each extension's own specification,
 * then the chains that string the specifications together, and last the block
 * table that points at all of it.  Every level is renumbered before anything
 * above it is rewritten.
 *
 * New ids are handed out in order of first appearance, which is the order
 * plain Pulseq would have assigned had it registered each row as it came.
