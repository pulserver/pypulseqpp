     * Repetition n plays the blocks with each RF pulse's field turned about z
     * by -phases[n], as a phase offset larger by phases[n] turns it, and with
     * gradients that differ from the blocks' by a waveform zero during every
     * pulse and every ADC window, whose area at the first sample of the
     * repetition's w-th window is areas[n][w], in 1/m, and over the repetition
     * zero. Its samples are demodulated with each window's phase larger by
     * adc_phases[n].
     *
     * One repetition applies an affine map to each isochromat's
     * magnetisation, and another to its transverse magnetisation at each
     * window's first sample: four plays of the blocks, from zero and from a
     * unit magnetisation along each axis, give both. A repetition turned about
     * z applies the maps turned alike, and a phase-encoding waveform turns the
     * transverse magnetisation by its area at the sample and nothing else, so
     * every repetition follows from the four plays. Each window is read by the
     * non-uniform FFT the isochromats read a window under a held gradient
     * with, and must be one.
     *
     * The isochromats hold the magnetisation at the start of the next
     * repetition to be played; blocks played on them in between break the
     * repetitions.
     *
     * The first play() moves the maps into the arrays the repetitions are
     * played from and frees them: split() and column_sums() come before it.
