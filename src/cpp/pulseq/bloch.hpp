/**
 * @file bloch.hpp
 * @brief Isochromats whose magnetisation the Bloch equation carries from one
 *        block to the next.
 *
 * The magnetisation turns about the field b = (Re b1, Im b1, bz), in Hz, in
 * the frame rotating at the reference frequency, as the magnetic moment of a
 * nucleus of positive gyromagnetic ratio precesses: dM/dt = 2 pi M x b, a
 * clockwise turn seen from the tip of b. Free precession, with a
 * piecewise-linear gradient, is integrated exactly. An RF pulse is a sequence
 * of steps holding b1 constant, each a rotation about the step's mean field
 * between two half steps of relaxation.
