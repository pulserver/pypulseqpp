/**
 * @file pulseqpp_eventtypes.h
 * @brief Python bindings for pulseq's event classes.
 *
 * These are what `pypulseqpp.make_*` hands back: the same events
 * PyPulseq builds, converted once into slots.  They quack like the
 * `SimpleNamespace` they replace -- `rf.signal` is the complex waveform at its
 * real amplitude, `grad.waveform` is the scaled samples -- so anything
 * downstream that reads an event keeps working.
 *
 * ### The point of them
 *
 * Reading a `SimpleNamespace` costs a dictionary lookup per field, and a
 * three-dimensional protocol reads tens of millions.  Here a field is an
 * offset.
 *
 * ### Setters do not validate
 *
 * Deliberately.  `make_*` checked the event when it built it; a loop that
 * moves a phase encode from one line to the next is not making a new
 * assertion about the hardware, and re-deriving one per block is precisely
 * the cost this exists to remove.  A caller that wants the checks back calls
 * `make_*` again.
 *
 * ### Scaling is one number
 *
 * `signal` and `waveform` are stored normalised beside a scalar amplitude, so
 * `rf.amplitude *= 0.5` is a single write and leaves the registered shape
 * valid.  Assigning to `signal` or `waveform` outright re-normalises and
 * drops the registration, because that really is a new waveform.
 *
 * ### Why these are hand-written CPython types
 *
 * A pybind11 `def_readwrite` is a property: reading one is a descriptor call
 * into a lambda, and it measured at 178 ns against a `SimpleNamespace`
 * field's 56 ns.  So the dictionary lookups removed from `add_block` came
 * straight back on the loop's own arithmetic, which touches an amplitude or a
 * phase offset several times per repetition.
 *
 * A `PyMemberDef` is not a call.  It is a type code and a byte offset, and
 * `PyMember_GetOne` reads the double out of the instance directly, so the C++
 * object has to live *inside* the `PyObject` rather than behind a pointer --
 * which is the one thing pybind11's instance layout will not do.  Hence
 * `Holder<T>`, nine static types, and `tp_members` for every scalar.  The
 * fields that are not scalars -- waveforms, names, the computed areas -- stay
 * accessor-shaped in `tp_getset`, where the cost is beside the work.
