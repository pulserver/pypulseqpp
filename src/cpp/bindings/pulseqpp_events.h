/**
 * @file pulseqpp_events.h
 * @brief `add_block(*events)`: PyPulseq event objects straight into the C++
 *        libraries, with no sequence object in between.
 *
 * This is the ergonomic path -- `seq.add_block(rf, gx, gy, gz, adc, lin, par)`
 * with the objects `make_trapezoid` and friends hand back -- and it is one
 * call per block rather than one per event, because everything between the
 * objects and the libraries is done here.
 *
 * The one cost that cannot be moved is that the events *are* Python objects:
 * a trapezoid is five attribute reads whoever does them.  They are done
 * against the instance dictionary with interned keys rather than through
 * `getattr`, which skips the descriptor protocol and the temporary each
 * lookup would otherwise build -- worth roughly a third of the extraction on
 * a block carrying seven events.
 *
 * Nothing is checked against a library on the way in and no waveform is
 * compressed: a scan built this way registers a row per use and a shape per
 * shot, and `remove_duplicates` followed by the writers' prewrite pass turns
 * that into the file.  Searching per event would make building quadratic in
 * the thing that is already the largest.

     * A sequence, plus the one thing the "register everything, sort it out
     * later" design cannot do blindly.
     *
     * Event rows are small -- a trapezoid is five doubles -- so appending one
     * per use and collapsing them at the end costs a few tens of bytes per
     * block and is plainly the right trade.  A *shape* is not small.  A spiral
     * arm is several thousand samples, and a stack-of-spirals protocol plays
     * half a million of them: registering the waveform again on every shot
     * would cost twenty-five gigabytes before deduplication ever ran, to end
     * up with the thousand distinct arms the scan actually has.
     *
     * So shapes -- and only shapes -- are remembered by the identity of the
     * array they came from.  Not by their contents: hashing a waveform per
     * shot is the cost this design exists to avoid.  A caller that reuses an
     * array registers its shape once; one that builds a new array every time
     * gets a new shape, which is exactly right, because it really is telling
     * us it made a new waveform.
     *
     * The arrays are held so their addresses cannot be reused by something
     * else once they are collected.

     * pass over the whole waveform -- and on a spiral protocol that pass, run
     * twice per shot for half a million shots, was an order of magnitude more
