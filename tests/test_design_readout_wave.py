"""Wave encoding: the corkscrew a readout plays, and what it must not disturb.

A wave-encoded readout spreads every voxel along itself, so the aliasing
parallel imaging has to separate is spread with it. What makes that usable
rather than merely clever is everything the corkscrew leaves alone: k has to
end where it would have ended without it, the gradients have to stay inside
the system, and switching it off for one readout has to change nothing else
about the sequence.
