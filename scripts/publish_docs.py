"""Place a built documentation tree into the published site, one version deep.

The site holds a directory per version: ``latest`` for main, one per release
tag, and ``stable``, a copy of the newest release. The root sends a reader to
``stable``, or to ``latest`` before there is a release, and ``versions.json``
beside them is the list the version switcher reads.

    python scripts/publish_docs.py docs/build/html latest ../pages

The third argument is a checkout of the branch the site is served from. Only
the published version's directory is replaced, and a release replaces
``stable`` only when it is the newest one. The site keeps ``latest``,
``stable`` and the ``--keep`` newest releases beside them; an older release is
removed, because the branch is never pruned otherwise and every version is a
whole documentation tree.
