# Security policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Report privately through
[GitHub's private advisory form](https://github.com/pulserver/pypulseqpp/security/advisories/new).
Please do not open a public issue for a vulnerability.

Include what you would need yourself to reproduce it: the version or commit,
the platform, and the smallest input that triggers it.

You can expect an acknowledgement within a week, an assessment of severity and
scope after that, and a fix released with the advisory once one is ready.
Credit goes to the reporter unless you ask otherwise.

## Supported versions

pypulseqpp is pre-1.0. Fixes land on the default branch and go out in the next
release; there are no maintained backport branches.

| Version | Supported |
|---|---|
| latest release | yes |
| older releases | no |

## Scope

In scope: anything that reads data from outside the process — file readers,
array deserialisation, and any path that accepts a filename from a caller.

Out of scope: resource exhaustion from inputs a caller chose themselves (an
array too large for the machine is a sizing question, not a vulnerability),
and behaviour under a deliberately hostile Python environment.
